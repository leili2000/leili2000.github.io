            Today, I woke up a little later than usual, then went to the
            bathroom to brush my teeth. Unexpectedly, my roommate had woken up
            earlier than usual today, and it was occupied. I went to go get
            dressed instead. After I finished getting ready, I went out into the
            kitchen. Since I woke up later than usual today, I didn't have time
            to make breakfast, so I just picked up a granola bar. Then, I left
            with two of my roommates to go to class. One came to Chem with me in
            Baker, and one split off to go to the Math and Science building.</br>
            After Chem, I went to the UU. There, I finished up my Hack4Impact
            starterpack project. That's all that's happened today so far!
